program to physically check a finance based question.

The aim is to find the optimal fees for a game with the intention of getting most possible profits to the seller/owner.
the game being that you roll a pair of dice and if you don't like the first outcome you can roll just once more. The payoff is whatever turns out to be the sum of the pair i.e. if you roll a 7 (2,5) you get Rs. 7. However, if you roll a 12 (6,6) you need to go again
i.e. you get an extra turn, apart from the 2 which you have (basically you can't roll a 12). You
get the payoff corresponding to the most recent sum (If on rolling once, you roll a 7 and on
your second turn, you roll a 2, then you get Rs. 2. If you had chosen to roll only once, then
you would have got Rs. 7). You can choose whether to roll the die a second time or not. How
much would a customer pay to play such a game?
