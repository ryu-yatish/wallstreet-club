program to physically check a finance based question.

You can roll a pair of die two times. The payoff is whatever turns out to be the sum of the
pair i.e. if you roll a 7 (2,5) you get Rs. 7. However, if you roll a 12 (6,6) you need to go again
i.e. you get an extra turn, apart from the 2 which you have (basically you can't roll a 12). You
get the payoff corresponding to the most recent sum (If on rolling once, you roll a 7 and on
your second turn, you roll a 2, then you get Rs. 2. If you had chosen to roll only once, then
you would have got Rs. 7). You can choose whether to roll the die a second time or not. How
much would a person pay for such a game?
